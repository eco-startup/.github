# Product Vision
# AI-Powered Life cycle Impact Platform

## What We’re Building
  A public-first, enterprise-grade AI platform that models and reports the environmental impact of products from cradle to grave — from material sourcing to disposal.
Our initial MVP focuses on the usage phase, helping individuals and consumers understand their footprint. Over time, we expand to serve manufacturers, governments, and environmental researchers with deep reporting, certification tools, and actionable insights.

## Key Features
### Public-Facing MVP
- Free-to-use app for anyone to input products and get sustainability reports
- AI-generated reports that show carbon impact, waste footprint, energy usage
- Gamified user experience: badges, rankings, shareable scorecards
- Education-first: promotes green consumer behavior and awareness

### Enterprise & Government Platform
- Full lifecycle modeling: includes material sourcing, manufacturing, usage, disposal
- Detailed sustainability reports: ready for audits, certifications, compliance
- API-first: enterprises can plug in our report engine into internal software
- Upload or stream datasets for bulk processing
- Region-aware insights via survey data integration (geo, climate, pollution, etc.)

## Data & Intelligence Pipeline
### Inputs:
- User product info
- Auto-enrichment via scraping & vector database (Pinecone/Chroma)
- Survey data (geo, environmental, biodiversity, etc.)
### Outputs:
- LLM-generated natural language reports
- Scored, structured, and visualized impact data
- Optimization recommendations (e.g., switch to greener materials)

## Business Model
### Public Use:
- Free forever
- Promoted through NGOs, eco-influencers, and educational campaigns
- Builds credibility and visibility as the go-to environmental impact benchmark
### Enterprise & Government:
#### Subscription model:
- Per-product analysis
- API usage tiers
- Dashboard access
#### Custom consulting tier:
- Compliance-aligned reporting
- Integration support
- Sector-specific insights (textile, electronics, FMCG, etc.)
#### Survey Agency Partnerships:
- Environmental or geological data bodies store and showcase their datasets on the platform
- Generate AI-based insights from large field surveys
  ##### Revenue from:
    - Data licensing
    - Co-branded reports
    - Analytics as a service

## Long-Term Vision
- Become the global benchmark for product sustainability reporting.
- Integrate into supply chains, government policy, and eco-certifications.
- Be the open ecosystem for environmental intelligence: from consumer awareness to global compliance.
